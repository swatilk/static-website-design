  <h2>About Be There Cook That</h2>
  
  <article id="about" align="justify">
  <p>Hello! My name is Swati and I am a Software Engineer. Recently married and moved to the United States. After I moved here, I have had plenty of time to experiment with new dishes and explore new places. I have loved every adventure till now. As I started experimenting with cooking, I began to grow more interest in it. And of course, this is possible because of my ever encouraging husband who has been my guinea pig and my travel companion! He is just amazing at what he does and he is a great cook too. So I get to taste his amazing dishes!
  <p> Be There Cook That is a result of the love and curiosity I have grown over the time towards cooking and travelling. I Cannot say this is it, this is the final website which has all my cooking and travel experiences. This is just a baby step I am taking towards becoming a food/travel blogger. As I continue to travel and cook more I keep adding them on my website. I hope you guys can make use of it and grow similar interest for food and travel that I have. Happy cooking and never let go of a chance to explore!
